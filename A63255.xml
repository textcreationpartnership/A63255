            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRIUMPHS OF JUSTICE OVER <hi>Vnju≈øt Iudges. &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UNdoubtedly there may be, becau≈øe there has been too often in the World; ≈øuch a thing, ≈øuch a ≈øin, ≈øuch a mi≈øchief, as <hi>Corruption of Iudges,</hi> that is, when by means of Pecuniary, or other Bribes, or (which is all out as bad) Threatnings, Promi≈øes of Reward, Malice, Revenge, hopes of greater, or fears of being turned out of pre≈øent Preferments, or any other ill motive; They that are appointed and Sworn to Admini≈øter <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> Right and Ju≈øtice, are wrap'd a≈øide, or <hi>Bia≈ø'd</hi> to <hi>≈øerve a Turn, or Wreck</hi> a <hi>private Grudge,</hi> or to <hi>free the Guilty,</hi> or <hi>condemn the Innocent;</hi> or to lean rather to the one ≈øide, than to the other; or wilfully to declare that to be <hi>Law,</hi> which they cannot but know is not ≈øo; or to adjudge puni≈øhments <hi>di≈øproportionate</hi> to the Crimes that appear before them, or any the like <hi>ba≈øe, illegal</hi> practi≈øes.</p>
            <p>How odious this Vice is, to <hi>God and Man,</hi> as being equally de≈øtructive to Religion, and Humane Society; and how ≈øeverely it has been heretofore puni≈øhed, by both, may appear by The En≈øuing Examples.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to God, who is <hi>Capitalis Ju≈øtitiarius Caeli &amp; Terrae,</hi> the Grand never-erring Ju≈øtitiary of all the World. His Sacred Word prohibits nothing more po≈øitively, nor omplain of any thing lowder, or with more repeated importunities. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not re≈øt the judgment of the poor in his cau≈øe; Thou ≈øhalt take no gift, for a gift blindeth the eye of the wi≈øe, and perverteth the words of the Righteous,</hi> Ex. 23.6 and 8 ver. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not re≈øt juegment; thou ≈øhalt not re≈øpect per≈øons, neither take a gift,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 16.19. Woe <hi>unto them that ju≈øtifie the wicked for reward, and taketh away the righteou≈øne≈øs of the righteous from him,</hi> I≈øa. 5.23. <hi>A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bo≈øome</hi> ('tis done you ≈øee <hi>≈ølyly,</hi> and in the <hi>dark</hi>) <hi>to pervert the ways of judgment,</hi> Prov. 17 23. <hi>Woe unto yee who turn judgment into wormwood, and leave off righteou≈øne≈øs in the earth,</hi> Amos 5.7. <hi>The good man is peri≈øhed out of the earth, and there is none upwright among≈øt men; They all lye in wait for bloud; they hunt every man his brother as with a net, that they may do evil with both hands earne≈øtly. The Prince asketh, and the Judg gapeth for a reward; and the great man uttereth his mi≈øchievous de≈øire, ≈øo they wrap
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51465:4"/>it up: the be≈øt of them is as a briar, the most upright is ≈øharper than a thorn-hedg,</hi> &amp;c. Mic. 7.2, 3, &amp; 4 ver. with many of the like Texts.</p>
            <p n="2">2, As corrupt Judges are thus obnoxious to the <hi>Cur≈øe of God,</hi> ≈øo hath his Divine Providence not ≈øeldome Executed it upon them even in this world by the hands of <hi>men.</hi> Nor indeed is there any thing that can render <hi>Kings</hi> (Gods Vicegerents) more <hi>Glorious,</hi> or better e≈øtabli≈øh any <hi>≈øtate,</hi> than to keep the Current of <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> clear and un≈øullied; and exemplarily to puni≈øh their Subordinate <hi>Mini≈øters,</hi> and e≈øpecially <hi>Judges</hi> that ≈øhall pre≈øume to <hi>impoi≈øon</hi> that Sacred <hi>Fountain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several Heathen Princes are Renowned for this whole≈øom ≈øeverity. 'Tis ≈øaid of <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, that he had ≈øuch an aver≈øion and abhorrence of unju≈øt Judges, that at the very ≈øight of them he would vomit <hi>Choler,</hi> &amp; was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with his fingers to <hi>pluck out their eyes-Theatrum Hi≈øtoricum, f.</hi> 546.</p>
            <p>The Mighty Monarch <hi>Camby≈øes,</hi> King of <hi>Per≈øia,</hi> finding that one <hi>Si≈øamnes</hi> his <hi>Chief Ju≈øtice</hi> (<hi>Proe≈øes</hi> our Author calls him in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>) had receiv'd a <hi>Bribe,</hi> and for the ≈øame pronounced an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øt Sentence, forthwith cau≈øed him to be Executed, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly flead, and with his skin cover'd the <hi>Common Seat</hi> of Ju≈øtice, and Con≈øtituted <hi>Otanes</hi> (the ≈øaid <hi>Si≈øamne≈ø</hi>'s own Son) Judg in his Room; That ≈øo beholding daily tho≈øe <hi>Reliques</hi> of his ju≈øtly-puni≈øht Father; It might ≈øerve as a <hi>Memento</hi> to him to act more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly. <hi>Chronicon Carionis l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>But not to ≈øearch ≈øo far off, ‚Äî our own Nation affords us (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) the mo≈øt notable and numerous Examples of <hi>Royal Ju≈øtice</hi> in this kind of any in the world. For we find it Recorded in that Antient Law-Book, Entituled The <hi>Mirrour</hi> of <hi>Ju≈øtices</hi> (mo≈øt of which is ≈øaid to be Compiled before the <hi>Conque≈øt,</hi> and Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Learned <hi>Andrew Horn</hi> in the Reign of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the I≈øt. and which is often Cited by the Famous Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> and to this day continues in good Repute among≈øt Lawyers) That King <hi>Alfred,</hi> a Renowned <hi>Saxon</hi>-Prince, who Governed this Realm about the Year of our Lord 900. did in one years ≈øpace bring to Condign puni≈øhment, <hi>no fewer than four and forty of his Ju≈øtices,</hi> (≈øo the Law Terms tho≈øe we call Judges; and this was long before, either Ju≈øtices of the Peace E≈øtabli≈øht, or the Courts fixed at <hi>Westminster:</hi> But Ju≈øtice was in tho≈øe days Admini≈øtred in the Countrey, in Neighbouring Courts, which yet (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the nature of the offences alledged again≈øt them) had <hi>jus vitae &amp; necis, power of life and death,</hi> and ≈øo may properly be

            <p>The Oaths of our Iudges of <hi>England,</hi> as they bind them to the <hi>due Admini≈øtration of Iu≈øtice to the Subject, according to the Laws,</hi> (which are every <hi>Free-mans</hi> Birth-Right) ≈øo al≈øo, as they be of the Kings Council, they are by ≈øuch their Oaths oblig'd, <hi>lawfully to coun≈øel him,</hi> that is, whenever their opinions are demanded, they are ≈øworn and bound to deliver them <hi>according to the Law.</hi>‚ÄîLet us ≈øee how our <hi>Ance≈øtors</hi> re≈øented the≈øe matters.</p>
            <p>In a Parliament held in the <hi>11th</hi> year of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. there was Iudgment of <hi>High-Trea≈øon</hi> given again≈øt 18 ≈øeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, and all, ≈øave one of them, of Eminent Rank; Three Privy Coun≈øelors, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Archbi≈øhop of York,</hi> The <hi>Duke of Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Earl of Suffolk,</hi> the <hi>Bi≈øhop of Exeter,</hi> the <hi>Kings Confe≈ø≈øour, Five Knights,</hi> of whom ≈øome had been Servants to <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3. and all, but one, Servants to the then King, and ≈øome of them of Noble De≈øcent; but that which I more particularly ob≈øerve, there were among≈øt them Six <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>Locton</hi> the Kings <hi>Serjeant at Law; Blake</hi> of the Kings <hi>Council at Law,</hi> and <hi>Usk</hi> the under-<hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff</hi> of <hi>Middle≈øex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the≈øe 18, 8 were Executed, that is, Sir <hi>Robert Tre≈øilian,</hi> the <hi>Lord Chief Iu≈øtice</hi> was drawn from the <hi>Tower,</hi> through the mid≈øt of <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and there <hi>Hanged;</hi> ≈øo likewi≈øe were <hi>Usk</hi> and <hi>Blake,</hi> and <hi>Sir Iohn Salisbury;</hi> but the other 4 <hi>Knights</hi> had the Favour to be <hi>Beheaded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three, that is, the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> died mi≈øerable Fugitives in forreign Parts.</p>
            <p>The other ≈øeven (whereof five were <hi>Judges</hi>) with much ado got a Pardon as to Life, but were bani≈øhed, and their Lands and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51465:8"/>Goods all forfeited; and it was made Felony for any to procure their Recalling home, and them≈øelves forthwith to be executed as Traytors, if at any time they ≈øhould pre≈øume to return.</p>
            <p>And of the≈øe eighteen Per≈øons, all ≈øave three were impeached by the <hi>Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Offences</hi> which procured the≈øe <hi>Exemplary Puni≈øhments,</hi> were briefly the≈øe:</p>
            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> the II. being an unthinking di≈ø≈øolute Prince, by the ill coun≈øel of ≈øome near his Per≈øon, there had during his minority happened divers mi≈øcarriages in the Government: To redre≈øs which, in a Parliament holden in the tenth year of his Reign, and the twentieth of his Age, a Commi≈ø≈øion was awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Twelve Peers,</hi> and others of greate≈øt Wi≈ødom and Ability, impowering them to in≈øpect the pa≈øt management of the <hi>Hou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> the <hi>Revenue,</hi> the <hi>Courts of Ju≈øtice,</hi> and in a word, all things that did concern the Good of the <hi>Realm;</hi> with full power final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to determine, and put all things in excution, ≈øo as might mo≈øt tend to the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>King, Relief</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Land;</hi> which <hi>Commi≈øsion</hi> was to endure onely one year.</p>
            <p>Now come five of the Per≈øons above-named, <hi>viz.</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øhop, the Duke, the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Chief <hi>Ju≈øtice,</hi> and <hi>Brembre,</hi> who ≈øeeing them≈øelves like to be called to Account for their pernitious Coun≈øels and Irregularities, and to be brought to de≈øerved ≈øhame and puni≈øhment; to avoid the ≈øame, and continue their Villanies for the future, they in≈øinuated to the King, <hi>That this Commi≈øsion intrenched upon the Royal Power, and was derogatory to the Crown, that the procurers thereof had extorted His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al A≈ø≈øent thereunto in Parliament;</hi> and <hi>that this was Trea≈øon:</hi> for ≈øo the Chief <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> the Kings Council, who was advi≈øed withal in the <hi>Writ,</hi> declared it to be; whereupon <hi>Blake</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to prepare an Indictment of Trea≈øon again≈øt all the ≈øaid Commi≈ø≈øioners, and again≈øt ≈øuch others as had been mo≈øt active in procuring that Authority: Accordingly he draws the Indictment which ≈øtands entred in the Roll, and is to this effect, <hi>That they the ≈øaid Commis≈øioners, &amp;c. had Traiterou≈øly con≈øpired among them≈øelves to make this Commis≈øion by Authority of Parliament again≈øt the Royalty of the King, to his di≈øheri≈øon, and in derogation of the Crown, and that they forced the Kings Con≈øent, and confederated them≈øelves to maintain one another in ≈øo doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51465:8"/>
            <p>It was de≈øigned that they ≈øhould be tryed upon this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Middle≈øex</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> and therefore (≈øome of the parties to be pro≈øecuted not being Peers) <hi>Usk</hi> the Under-Sheriff of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle≈øex</hi> was acquainted with the bu≈øine≈øs, (who was to return a Pack'd-Iury (you ≈øee that's a very old <hi>Game</hi>) that might be ≈øure to do the bu≈øine≈øs, which he performing accordingly, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>hang'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, the five grand <hi>Favourites,</hi> that the King might the more confide in their Coun≈øels, (for ≈øo are the words of the <hi>Record</hi>) and that under colour of Law, they might cover their malice from the King and the Kingdom, before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als were to be brought on, advi≈øe the King to demand the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ≈øome of the <hi>Judges,</hi> that is, of the two <hi>Chief Ju≈øtices</hi> and <hi>Chief Baron,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> ≈øix in all in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and of <hi>Locton</hi> the <hi>Kings Serjeant; Blake,</hi> of the <hi>Kings Council at Law,</hi> was commanded to draw up tho≈øe <hi>Que≈øtions,</hi> who did it accordingly, and for <hi>drawing</hi> the ≈øame, and the before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Indictment, he was him≈øelf <hi>Drawn</hi> and <hi>Hanged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Que≈øtions</hi> being prepared in Writing; the <hi>Iudges</hi> were ≈øent for to <hi>Nottingham Ca≈øtle,</hi> where in the Kings own Pre≈øence, they were commanded upon their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to deliver their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Whether the Commis≈øion was derogatory to the Rights of the Crown?</hi> They an≈øwered, <hi>It was.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Whether the per≈øuading and urging the King to con≈øent thereunto in Parliament, was Trea≈øon?</hi> They an≈øwered, <hi>That it was.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Here were other <hi>Que≈øtions</hi> ask'd, but the≈øe were the Main, and <hi>tho≈øe for which they were condemned,</hi> as appears by the Replication of the <hi>Commons</hi> to the <hi>Iudges An≈øwer,</hi> and by the Words of the <hi>Iudgment ‚Äî That they the ≈øaid</hi> Iudges <hi>knew that this Commis≈øion was awarded in Parliament, &amp;c. that it was for the Publick Good; That they knew of the Traiterous Intent to de≈øtroy the Procurers of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis≈øion; That they knew the Law, and that it was not Trea≈øon, and had delivered ≈øuch Opinions thereby, under colour of Law, to cover their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable Intent,</hi> and therefore Iudgment of <hi>High-Trea≈øon</hi> was given again≈øt them, and again≈øt <hi>Locton</hi> the Kings <hi>Serjeant,</hi> who had Sub≈øcribed the≈øe Fal≈øe Opinions with the <hi>Iudges.</hi> And though there be other Articles again≈øt the <hi>Re≈øt,</hi> yet this alone is adjudged <hi>Trea≈øon,</hi> in the ≈øeveral <hi>Iudgments</hi> again≈øt every one of the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen: And 'tis ob≈øervable, <hi>That in all the≈øe Iudgments, they are adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51465:9"/>Traitors as well again≈øt the Per≈øon of the King, as again≈øt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is there declared upon great Advice taken, <hi>That in Trea≈øons which concern the King and Kingdom, they are not bound to proceed according to the Rules of the Common-Law, but according to the Cour≈øe of Parliaments, ≈øo as may be for the Common-Good.</hi> Nor were the≈øe <hi>Iudgments</hi> huddled up in ha≈øte, but given upon long and mature Deliberation, <hi>the Work of a Whole Parliament.</hi> And it is declared in the <hi>Roll, That they ≈øpent long time, and took great pains in examining the Evidence,</hi> the better thereby to ≈øatisfie their own Con≈øciences and the World. Their Proceedings again≈øt the five Plotters were begun the 14 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> and the <hi>Iudgments</hi> were not given till the 15 of <hi>Feb.</hi> following, which is a <hi>Quarter</hi> of a <hi>Year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis al≈øo to be ob≈øerved, <hi>That ≈øeveral of the≈øe Iudges were very unwilling to give their</hi> Corrupt Opinions, <hi>but were</hi> menaced <hi>and</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently <hi>drawn thereunto by the Duke of</hi> Ireland <hi>and others.</hi> And at their <hi>Trials,</hi> they ≈øeverally Alledged, <hi>That in part</hi> Violence <hi>had been offered to their Per≈øons, becau≈øe they had deferred the delivery of their Opinions.</hi> But as <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Cowardice</hi> is no <hi>Plea</hi> for delivering up of the <hi>Forts</hi> or <hi>Bulwarks</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ≈øo neither is it for <hi>ba≈øely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying our Rights and Liberties.</hi> The≈øe Allegations of being <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their Duty,</hi> could not excu≈øe them from the <hi>Rope:</hi> but how much more then do they de≈øerve it who ≈øhall pre≈øume to do as bad things or <hi>wor≈øe,</hi> without any <hi>Menaces</hi> at all, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and pre≈øumptuou≈øly, purely out of their own ba≈øe inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Tre≈øilian</hi> was not the onely Iudge which our <hi>Engli≈øh Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory,</hi> even ≈øince the Conque≈øt, mentions to have been executed for irregular Practices: For in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, a <hi>Wi≈øe</hi> but <hi>Avaritious</hi> Prince, there were two Gentlemen of the Long Robe, that for private Intere≈øt, and to ≈øerve the Kings pre≈øent <hi>Turn,</hi> were ready to di≈øpence with their <hi>Oaths,</hi> and the known Fundamental Laws.

            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Names</hi> were, Sir <hi>Richard Emp≈øon</hi> Knight, and <hi>Edmund Dudley,</hi> both (≈øaith Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> fol. 247.) <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and both of them <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and <hi>Iu≈øtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>England: Dudley</hi> of a good Family, but <hi>Emp≈øon</hi> the Son of

            <p>The <hi>King</hi> made odd U≈øe of the≈øe Two In≈øtruments. <hi>They turn'd</hi> (≈øayes <hi>Baker</hi>) <hi>Law into Rapine.</hi> And mo≈øt certain it is, that many ill Things they did: But the better to colour their vile Practi≈øes, a Statute was Provided, to Ju≈øtify their Inva≈øions on the Liberties and Properties of their <hi>Fellow-Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will give you an Account of this Matter, in the very Words of that Great <hi>Oracle of our Law,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cook.</hi> But fir≈øt, hear how Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> in his <hi>Chronicle, fol.</hi> 247. repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øents them:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Their Manner was <hi>(≈øaith he)</hi> to cau≈øe divers Subjects to be Indicted of Crimes, and then pre≈øently to Commit them, and not Produce them to their An≈øwer, but ≈øuffer them to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh long in Pri≈øon; and by ≈øundry Artificial Devices and Terror, extort from them great <hi>Fines,</hi> which they termed <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions</hi> and <hi>Mitigations.</hi> Neither did they (towards the End) ob≈øerve ≈øo much as the Half-Face of <hi>Ju≈øtice,</hi> in Proceeding by Indictment; but ≈øent forth their Precepts to Attach Men, and Convent them before Them≈øelves, and ≈øome Others, at their private Hou≈øes; and there ≈øhuffle up a Summary Proceeding by Examination, <hi>Without Tryal by Iury;</hi> a≈ø≈øuming to them≈øelves to deal both in <hi>Pleas of the Crown,</hi> and <hi>Controver≈øies Civil.</hi> Then did they al≈øo u≈øe to Enthral, and Charge the Subjects Land with Tenures <hi>in Capite,</hi> by finding Fal≈øe Offices, refu≈øing upon divers Pretexts and Delayes, to admit Men to Traver≈øe tho≈øe Fal≈øe Offices. Nay, contrary to all Law and Colour, they maintain'd, That the <hi>King</hi> ought to have the Half of Mens Lands and Rents, during the Space of full Two Years, for a Pain, in ca≈øe of <hi>Outlawry.</hi> They would likewi≈øe <hi>Ruffle</hi> with <hi>Jurors,</hi> and enforce them to Find, as they would Direct: And if they did not, then Convent, Impri≈øon, and Fine them.

            <p>But it is to be noted, That though all the <hi>Judges</hi> did thus Sign this An≈øwer; yet it was not according to all their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; for <hi>Crook</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi> di≈ø-a≈ø≈øented, and declared, That ≈øuch a Charge could not be laid by any ≈øuch Writ; but by <hi>Parliament.</hi> But the Major-Part of the <hi>Judges,</hi> being ab≈øolutely Re≈øolved upon that Opinion, pre≈ø≈øed them to Sub≈øcribe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe with the re≈øt; for that the Greater Number mu≈øt involve and conclude the Le≈øs; which, they ≈øaid, was u≈øual in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of Reference; And that the Le≈ø≈øer Number mu≈øt ≈øubmit to the Opinion of the More, although they varied in Opinion: As in the Courts of Law; If <hi>Three Judges</hi> agree in Opinion again≈øt <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two,</hi> where there is <hi>Five Judges,</hi> Judgment is to be Entred <hi>per Curiam,</hi> if the <hi>Major Part</hi> agree, and the <hi>Others</hi> are to ≈øubmit unto it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (The≈øe are the very Words of <hi>Judge Crook,</hi> excu≈øing him≈øelf for having thus Sub≈øcribed: See the <hi>Arguments</hi> on <hi>Hampden</hi>'s <hi>Ca≈øe,</hi> p. 12.)</p>
            <p>Having thus got the Bu≈øine≈øs <hi>back't</hi> with the <hi>Sub≈øcriptions</hi> of all the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the ≈øame were <hi>Enrolled</hi> in all the Courts of <hi>Westmin≈øter-Hall:</hi> And now, they began to Pro≈øecute brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the <hi>Defaulters;</hi> among≈øt whom, the Chiefe≈øt was <hi>John Hampden</hi> of <hi>Buckingham-≈øhire,</hi> E≈øquire, who had upon one of the≈øe Ship - Writs directed to the Sheriff of that County, been A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> for his Lands in <hi>Stoke-Mandevil,</hi> in that County; which not being paid, was Certified (among≈øt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) into the <hi>Chancery,</hi> upon a Writ of <hi>Certiorari,</hi> Dated 9

Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, he being Summoned, Appeared, and demanded <hi>Oyer</hi> of tho≈øe <hi>Writs</hi> and <hi>Schedule;</hi> which being Entred, he <hi>Demurr'd in Law;</hi> that is, demanded the Opinion and Judgment of the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> Whether this <hi>Writ</hi> were ≈øufficient <hi>in Law,</hi> to Force him to pay the ≈øaid <hi>Twenty Shillings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being a <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>General Ca≈øe,</hi> the Barons of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> de≈øired the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the re≈øt of the <hi>Judges,</hi> who did Joyn accordingly.

                  </gap>ctus</hi> Johannes Hampden. <hi>de ei≈ødem viginti ≈øolidis oneretur, &amp; inde ≈øatisfaciat: That the ≈øaid ≈øeveral Writs and Returns thereof, and the Schedules thereunto annex't, and the Matter in the ≈øame contained, are ≈øufficient in Law to Charge the ≈øaid</hi> John Hampden <hi>with, the Twenty Shillings upon him, in the Form, and by Vertue of the A≈ø≈øe≈øsment afore-≈øaid impo≈øed. Therefore, it is con≈øidered by the ≈øaid Barons, That the ≈øaid</hi> John Hampden <hi>≈øhall be Charged, and ≈øhall ≈øatisfy the ≈øame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Judgment</hi> was impo≈øed, as ≈øuch an <hi>Infallible Determination</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:51465:16"/>of the Law in this Ca≈øe, that no further Di≈øpute would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd thereof to any others; in≈øomuch, that a Per≈øon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, having a Ca≈øe depending in the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed any Argument or Debate, concerning the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> for no other Rea≈øon, but that it had been by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Judgment,</hi> decided already in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may perhaps be ≈øaid: <hi>This Impo≈øition of</hi> Ship-Money <hi>was</hi> ≈ømall <hi>and</hi> incon≈øiderable; <hi>Mr.</hi> Hampden, <hi>a Gentleman of a fair F≈øtare, was A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed but</hi> Twenty Shillings: <hi>And, Why ≈øhould any Body-≈øcruple ≈øuch a petty Bu≈øine≈øs, when the</hi> King <hi>Commanded it?

Or, What Harm could accrue to the</hi> Publick, <hi>by the</hi> Judges <hi>allowing the</hi> King <hi>Power to Impo≈øe ≈øuch an A≈ø≈øe≈øsment, when it was for the Defence of the Realm from</hi> Eminent <hi>and</hi> Imminent <hi>Danger, and he exerted that Power ≈øo favourably,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In <hi>An≈øwer</hi> to ≈øuch <hi>Objections,</hi> it mu≈øt be ≈øaid; That true it is, it was then only Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi>'s Ca≈øe; but the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every individual Subject of <hi>England,</hi> was concern'd in it: nay, ≈øo far concern'd, that all his E≈øtate and Liberty was therein given up. The <hi>Que≈øtion</hi> was not <hi>Quantum,</hi> but <hi>Quo Jure?</hi> If Publick Danger might give the <hi>King</hi> Title to lay Impo≈øitions without a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and He alone were <hi>Judge</hi> of ≈øuch Danger, When might it not be alledged? If <hi>Twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> were A≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed on Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> that Year, How did it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> might be required the next, and <hi>Two Thou≈øand Pounds</hi> the Year following? And, What U≈øe, what Occa≈øion would the <hi>Court</hi> have had for ever afterwards, of a <hi>Parliament?</hi> But as to the <hi>Illegality</hi> of the≈øe <hi>Ship-Writs,</hi> I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to Judge <hi>Crook</hi>'s <hi>Argument;</hi> where the ≈øame is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrated to be again≈øt the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> again≈øt divers <hi>Statutes,</hi> not to be maintain'd by any <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or Power Royal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable by any former <hi>Precedents,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let us ≈øee then, what were the <hi>Con≈øequences</hi> of the≈øe <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial</hi> Opinions, and this <hi>Illegal</hi> Judgment of the <hi>Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> As to the <hi>King:</hi> They thereby mi≈ø-led him (as much as in them lay) to Di≈øcompo≈øe the Harmony of <hi>Government;</hi> to Entrench upon the <hi>Property</hi> of His Subjects; and (contrary to his Intentions) by Colour of Right, to violate the Laws, which, no doubt, that <hi>Good Prince</hi> meant to have pre≈øerv'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:51465:16"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the <hi>Subjects:</hi> They were not only hereby In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, but their <hi>Affections Alienated</hi> from their Sovereign; which to occa≈øion, is no doubt a very High (becau≈øe almo≈øt Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable) <hi>Trea≈øon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Genuine Sen≈øe of the≈øe <hi>Re≈øolutions,</hi> being no le≈øs than this; That the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> as <hi>often</hi> as Him≈øelf plea≈øeth, may declare the Kingdom to be in Danger, and that ≈øo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, His Maje≈øty, for Prevention of ≈øuch Dangers, may, by His Writ under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> alter the <hi>Property</hi> of the Subject's Goods, without their Con≈øent in <hi>Parliamen;</hi> and that in <hi>≈øuch Proportions,</hi> as His Maje≈øty ≈øhall think fit: And be≈øides, may deprive them of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of their Per≈øons, and that in ≈øuch Manner as Him≈øelf ≈øhall plea≈øe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the <hi>Judges</hi> them≈øelves: It prov'd de≈øervedly <hi>Fatal;</hi> For no ≈øooner was a <hi>Parliament</hi> Call'd, but they were call'd to Account for the≈øe their Illegal Opinions and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And after a long Debate, on <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1640. the≈øe <hi>Four</hi> ≈øeveral <hi>Votes</hi> Pa≈ø≈øed upon them, without ≈øo much as <hi>One Negative Voice</hi> to any of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>THat the Charge impo≈øed upon the Subjects, for the Providing and Furni≈øhing of Ships; and the A≈ø≈øe≈øsments for Rai≈øing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that purpo≈øe, commonly called Ship-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, are again≈øt the Laws of the Realm, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Right of Property, and contrary to former Re≈øolutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Extrajudicial Opinions of the Iudges, Publi≈øhed in the</hi> Star-Chamber, <hi>and Inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Courts at</hi> We≈øtmin≈øter <hi>(before Recited) in the whole, and in every part of them are again≈øt the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, and the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Re≈øolutions in Parliament; and to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Writ to the Sheriff of</hi> Bucks <hi>(particularly Recited) and the other Writs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Ship-Writs; are again≈øt the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51465:17"/>of the Subjects, and contrary to former Re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the Iudgment in Mr.</hi> Hampden's <hi>Ca≈øe (as before Recited) in the matter and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance thereof; and in that it was conceived that Mr.</hi> Hampden <hi>was any way Chargeable, is again≈øt the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Re≈øolutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The≈øe <hi>Votes</hi> being Tran≈ømitted by the <hi>Commons</hi> to the <hi>Hou≈øe of Lords;</hi> Their Lord≈øhips did Concur therein. And on <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 26. of <hi>February,</hi> 1640. It was Ordered by the Lords <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> in the High <hi>Court of Parliament,</hi> A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; That the <hi>Lord-Keeper,</hi> or <hi>Ma≈øter of the Rolls,</hi> the <hi>Two</hi> Lord <hi>Chief Ju≈øtices,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Chief Baron;</hi> and likewi≈øe the <hi>Chief Clerk of the Star-Chamber,</hi> ≈øhould bring into the Upper <hi>Hou≈øe of Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Records</hi> of the Judgment again≈øt Mr. <hi>Hampden,</hi> concerning <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> in each of tho≈øe ≈øeveral Courts, and that a <hi>Vacat</hi> thereof ≈øhould be made. And that a Copy of the Judgment of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> concerning the <hi>Illegality</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ≈øhould be Delivered to the ≈øeveral <hi>Judges of A≈ø≈øize;</hi> and that they ≈øhould be required to Publi≈øh the ≈øame in all the <hi>Circuits.</hi> Which on the 27. of the ≈øame <hi>February,</hi> was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: the ≈øaid <hi>Records</hi> being <hi>Vacated,</hi> and the <hi>Rolls</hi> Cro≈øs'd with a Pen in the <hi>Hou≈øe of Lords,</hi> and Sub≈øcribed with the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Parliament's</hi> Hand.</p>
            <p>And ≈øoon after, ≈øeveral of the before-named Judges were <hi>Impeached</hi> for the ≈øame in <hi>Parliament:</hi> And not daring to ≈øtand the <hi>Shock,</hi> ≈øome of them, as the Lord <hi>Chief Ju≈øtice Finch,</hi> Fled beyond the Seas; and <hi>others</hi> Ab≈øconded. And ≈øoon after, came on the Unnatural <hi>Civil-Wars,</hi> ≈øo De≈øtructive to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> which, though no way Ju≈øtifiable, yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed; but they were not a little <hi>Occa≈øion'd,</hi> and the Animo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People, blown into an Untameable <hi>Flame,</hi> by the≈øe ba≈øe Traiterous Proceedings of tho≈øe <hi>Sycophant Judges.</hi> And <hi>Woe unto tho≈øe</hi> (≈øay Sacred <hi>Oracles</hi>) <hi>by whom Offences come.</hi>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51465:20"/>making tho≈øe Writs. The Queen ≈øends a <hi>Sharp</hi> Letter, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them forthwith to Admit him: Then She ≈øends a more po≈øitive Command, requiring the Rea≈øon of their <hi>Contempt</hi> and Di≈øobedience. The Judges return the beforementioned Rea≈øon to the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Leice≈øter</hi> (no mean Man in tho≈øe Days) upon which, the Queen ≈øends a <hi>Fourth Peremptory</hi> Me≈ø≈øage for their Admitting him, with this Rea≈øon: That if the others were put out, they were <hi>Rich,</hi> and Able Men, and that Her Courts of Ju≈øtice were <hi>Open,</hi> where they might Demand their Right; for this was not to debar them <hi>Therefrom,</hi> but only to put them to their <hi>Action.</hi> The <hi>Hone≈øt Judges</hi> roturned this An≈øwer, That the Queen had taken Her <hi>Oath,</hi> for the due Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Ju≈øtice <hi>According to Law,</hi> and they did not doubt, but when Her Maje≈øty was Informed it was again≈øt the Law, She would Act therein as became her. For their own parts, they had taken an <hi>Oath</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Her,</hi> and the <hi>Common-Wealth;</hi> And if they ≈øhould do it without <hi>Proce≈øs</hi> of Law before them, and only upon Her Command put the others out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, though the Right remained to them, it were a Breach of their <hi>Oath;</hi> and therefore, if the Fear of <hi>God</hi> were not Sufficient, they told Her the Puni≈øhment, that was Inflicted upon their <hi>Predece≈ø≈øors</hi> for Breach of their Oaths (citing <hi>Thorpe,</hi> &amp;c.) might be a ≈øufficient <hi>Warning</hi> to them: Whereupon the Queen hearing the≈øe Rea≈øons, was Satisfied; and the ≈øaid Judges heard no more of this Bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
            <p>To De≈øcend nearer our own Times, we cannot omit that grand Example of <hi>Uprightne≈øs,</hi> the ever Famous Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> late Lord Chief Ju≈øtice of the King's-Bench; a <hi>Miracle</hi> for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>Polite</hi> and <hi>Serious</hi> Learning, as well as profound Knowledge in the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Of whom I ≈øhall yet, not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any particular <hi>In≈øtances,</hi> ≈øince his whole Life was one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Thred of <hi>Sincere, and Under≈øtanding Ju≈øtice:</hi> For as ea≈øily you might have ju≈øtled the <hi>Sun</hi> out of the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> as to have warp'd him from his con≈øtant Road of <hi>Integrity.</hi> An exact <hi>Standard</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Future Princes</hi> may mea≈øure the Qualifications of their <hi>Judges;</hi> for though he were a mo≈øt <hi>Loyal,</hi> and Zealous Servant to the <hi>Crown;</hi> yet he was ≈øo far from being ever <hi>Impeached</hi> by the <hi>Repre≈øentative Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of the Nation, that no one <hi>Single</hi> Per≈øon (no not of tho≈øe that were <hi>Ca≈øt</hi> before him) were ever heard to complain of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>And if any <hi>Latter</hi> Judges have been di≈ømi≈øs'd by fal≈øe Tales of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51465:21"/>Sycophant <hi>Whi≈øperers,</hi> or for oppo≈øing ba≈øe <hi>Illegal Arbitrary Intere≈øts;</hi> as they have the Invaluable Satisfaction of a good <hi>Con≈øcience</hi> for their Comfort; ≈øo they may be a≈ø≈øured, they ≈øtill appear more Glorious in the Eyes of all good <hi>Engli≈øh</hi>-Men at pre≈øent, and will be Recorded more Venerable to Po≈øterity, than any <hi>Robes</hi> or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, ≈øullied with <hi>Bribery, Flattery,</hi> or <hi>Treacherous</hi> Compliances, could renden them.</p>
            <p>However, we hope the <hi>Various Examples,</hi> we have here Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated from Authentick <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Hi≈øtories,</hi> may be ≈øufficient to Deterr future <hi>Judges</hi> from Ill Cour≈øes; and ≈øatisfie all the World, both in the <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> of the Parliaments late Proceedings in this Ca≈øe, and the <hi>Rea≈øonablene≈øs</hi> of their <hi>Vote</hi> and intended <hi>Bill,</hi> That <hi>Judges</hi> henceforth ≈øhould hold their Places, and Salaries, not <hi>Ad Placitum;</hi> but <hi>Quam Diu ≈øe bene ga≈ø≈øerint.</hi> Which was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Aim of the≈øe Papers. <hi>Fiat Ju≈øtitia.</hi>
