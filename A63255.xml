            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRIUMPHS OF JUSTICE OVER <hi>Vnjuſt Iudges. &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UNdoubtedly there may be, becauſe there has been too often in the World; ſuch a thing, ſuch a ſin, ſuch a miſchief, as <hi>Corruption of Iudges,</hi> that is, when by means of Pecuniary, or other Bribes, or (which is all out as bad) Threatnings, Promiſes of Reward, Malice, Revenge, hopes of greater, or fears of being turned out of preſent Preferments, or any other ill motive; They that are appointed and Sworn to Adminiſter <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> Right and Juſtice, are wrap'd aſide, or <hi>Biaſ'd</hi> to <hi>ſerve a Turn, or Wreck</hi> a <hi>private Grudge,</hi> or to <hi>free the Guilty,</hi> or <hi>condemn the Innocent;</hi> or to lean rather to the one ſide, than to the other; or wilfully to declare that to be <hi>Law,</hi> which they cannot but know is not ſo; or to adjudge puniſhments <hi>diſproportionate</hi> to the Crimes that appear before them, or any the like <hi>baſe, illegal</hi> practiſes.</p>
            <p>How odious this Vice is, to <hi>God and Man,</hi> as being equally deſtructive to Religion, and Humane Society; and how ſeverely it has been heretofore puniſhed, by both, may appear by The Enſuing Examples.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to God, who is <hi>Capitalis Juſtitiarius Caeli &amp; Terrae,</hi> the Grand never-erring Juſtitiary of all the World. His Sacred Word prohibits nothing more poſitively, nor omplain of any thing lowder, or with more repeated importunities. <hi>Thou ſhalt not reſt the judgment of the poor in his cauſe; Thou ſhalt take no gift, for a gift blindeth the eye of the wiſe, and perverteth the words of the Righteous,</hi> Ex. 23.6 and 8 ver. <hi>Thou ſhalt not reſt juegment; thou ſhalt not reſpect perſons, neither take a gift,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 16.19. Woe <hi>unto them that juſtifie the wicked for reward, and taketh away the righteouſneſs of the righteous from him,</hi> Iſa. 5.23. <hi>A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome</hi> ('tis done you ſee <hi>ſlyly,</hi> and in the <hi>dark</hi>) <hi>to pervert the ways of judgment,</hi> Prov. 17 23. <hi>Woe unto yee who turn judgment into wormwood, and leave off righteouſneſs in the earth,</hi> Amos 5.7. <hi>The good man is periſhed out of the earth, and there is none upwright amongſt men; They all lye in wait for bloud; they hunt every man his brother as with a net, that they may do evil with both hands earneſtly. The Prince asketh, and the Judg gapeth for a reward; and the great man uttereth his miſchievous deſire, ſo they wrap
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51465:4"/>it up: the beſt of them is as a briar, the most upright is ſharper than a thorn-hedg,</hi> &amp;c. Mic. 7.2, 3, &amp; 4 ver. with many of the like Texts.</p>
            <p n="2">2, As corrupt Judges are thus obnoxious to the <hi>Curſe of God,</hi> ſo hath his Divine Providence not ſeldome Executed it upon them even in this world by the hands of <hi>men.</hi> Nor indeed is there any thing that can render <hi>Kings</hi> (Gods Vicegerents) more <hi>Glorious,</hi> or better eſtabliſh any <hi>ſtate,</hi> than to keep the Current of <hi>Juſtice</hi> clear and unſullied; and exemplarily to puniſh their Subordinate <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Judges</hi> that ſhall preſume to <hi>impoiſon</hi> that Sacred <hi>Fountain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several Heathen Princes are Renowned for this wholeſom ſeverity. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, that he had ſuch an averſion and abhorrence of unjuſt Judges, that at the very ſight of them he would vomit <hi>Choler,</hi> &amp; was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with his fingers to <hi>pluck out their eyes-Theatrum Hiſtoricum, f.</hi> 546.</p>
            <p>The Mighty Monarch <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> finding that one <hi>Siſamnes</hi> his <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> (<hi>Proeſes</hi> our Author calls him in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>) had receiv'd a <hi>Bribe,</hi> and for the ſame pronounced an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Sentence, forthwith cauſed him to be Executed, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly flead, and with his skin cover'd the <hi>Common Seat</hi> of Juſtice, and Conſtituted <hi>Otanes</hi> (the ſaid <hi>Siſamneſ</hi>'s own Son) Judg in his Room; That ſo beholding daily thoſe <hi>Reliques</hi> of his juſtly-puniſht Father; It might ſerve as a <hi>Memento</hi> to him to act more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly. <hi>Chronicon Carionis l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>But not to ſearch ſo far off, — our own Nation affords us (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) the moſt notable and numerous Examples of <hi>Royal Juſtice</hi> in this kind of any in the world. For we find it Recorded in that Antient Law-Book, Entituled The <hi>Mirrour</hi> of <hi>Juſtices</hi> (moſt of which is ſaid to be Compiled before the <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> and Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Learned <hi>Andrew Horn</hi> in the Reign of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the Iſt. and which is often Cited by the Famous Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> and to this day continues in good Repute amongſt Lawyers) That King <hi>Alfred,</hi> a Renowned <hi>Saxon</hi>-Prince, who Governed this Realm about the Year of our Lord 900. did in one years ſpace bring to Condign puniſhment, <hi>no fewer than four and forty of his Juſtices,</hi> (ſo the Law Terms thoſe we call Judges; and this was long before, either Juſtices of the Peace Eſtabliſht, or the Courts fixed at <hi>Westminster:</hi> But Juſtice was in thoſe days Adminiſtred in the Countrey, in Neighbouring Courts, which yet (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the nature of the offences alledged againſt them) had <hi>jus vitae &amp; necis, power of life and death,</hi> and ſo may properly be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51465:4"/>called Judges) whoſe Names and particular Crimes here follow in the words of that worthy Author, <hi>p.</hi> 296. of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 239 of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Edition.</p>
            <p>It is an abuſe that Juſtices and their Officers who kill People by <hi>falſe judgment,</hi> be not deſtroyed, which King <hi>Alfred</hi> cauſed to be done, who cauſed <hi>Forty four Iuſtices</hi> in one year, to be hanged as <hi>Murderers</hi> fer their <hi>falſe judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He hanged <hi>Darling</hi> becauſe he judged <hi>Sidulf</hi> to death, for the retreat of <hi>Edulf</hi> his Son, who afterward; acquitted him of the Fact.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hanged <hi>Segnar,</hi> who judged <hi>Ulf</hi> to death after ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>acquittal.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> the II. being an unthinking diſſolute Prince, by the ill counſel of ſome near his Perſon, there had during his minority happened divers miſcarriages in the Government: To redreſs which, in a Parliament holden in the tenth year of his Reign, and the twentieth of his Age, a Commiſſion was awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Twelve Peers,</hi> and others of greateſt Wiſdom and Ability, impowering them to inſpect the paſt management of the <hi>Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> the <hi>Revenue,</hi> the <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> and in a word, all things that did concern the Good of the <hi>Realm;</hi> with full power final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to determine, and put all things in excution, ſo as might moſt tend to the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>King, Relief</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Land;</hi> which <hi>Commiſsion</hi> was to endure onely one year.</p>
            <p>Now come five of the Perſons above-named, <hi>viz.</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, the Duke, the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Chief <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Brembre,</hi> who ſeeing themſelves like to be called to Account for their pernitious Counſels and Irregularities, and to be brought to deſerved ſhame and puniſhment; to avoid the ſame, and continue their Villanies for the future, they inſinuated to the King, <hi>That this Commiſsion intrenched upon the Royal Power, and was derogatory to the Crown, that the procurers thereof had extorted His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Aſſent thereunto in Parliament;</hi> and <hi>that this was Treaſon:</hi> for ſo the Chief <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Blake</hi> the Kings Council, who was adviſed withal in the <hi>Writ,</hi> declared it to be; whereupon <hi>Blake</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to prepare an Indictment of Treaſon againſt all the ſaid Commiſſioners, and againſt ſuch others as had been moſt active in procuring that Authority: Accordingly he draws the Indictment which ſtands entred in the Roll, and is to this effect, <hi>That they the ſaid Commisſioners, &amp;c. had Traiterouſly conſpired among themſelves to make this Commisſion by Authority of Parliament againſt the Royalty of the King, to his diſheriſon, and in derogation of the Crown, and that they forced the Kings Conſent, and confederated themſelves to maintain one another in ſo doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51465:8"/>
            <p>It was deſigned that they ſhould be tryed upon this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Middleſex</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> and therefore (ſome of the parties to be proſecuted not being Peers) <hi>Usk</hi> the Under-Sheriff of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex</hi> was acquainted with the buſineſs, (who was to return a Pack'd-Iury (you ſee that's a very old <hi>Game</hi>) that might be ſure to do the buſineſs, which he performing accordingly, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>hang'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, the five grand <hi>Favourites,</hi> that the King might the more confide in their Counſels, (for ſo are the words of the <hi>Record</hi>) and that under colour of Law, they might cover their malice from the King and the Kingdom, before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als were to be brought on, adviſe the King to demand the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome of the <hi>Judges,</hi> that is, of the two <hi>Chief Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Chief Baron,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> ſix in all in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and of <hi>Locton</hi> the <hi>Kings Serjeant; Blake,</hi> of the <hi>Kings Council at Law,</hi> was commanded to draw up thoſe <hi>Queſtions,</hi> who did it accordingly, and for <hi>drawing</hi> the ſame, and the before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Indictment, he was himſelf <hi>Drawn</hi> and <hi>Hanged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Queſtions</hi> being prepared in Writing; the <hi>Iudges</hi> were ſent for to <hi>Nottingham Caſtle,</hi> where in the Kings own Preſence, they were commanded upon their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to deliver their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Whether the Commisſion was derogatory to the Rights of the Crown?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>It was.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Whether the perſuading and urging the King to conſent thereunto in Parliament, was Treaſon?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>That it was.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Here were other <hi>Queſtions</hi> ask'd, but theſe were the Main, and <hi>thoſe for which they were condemned,</hi> as appears by the Replication of the <hi>Commons</hi> to the <hi>Iudges Anſwer,</hi> and by the Words of the <hi>Iudgment — That they the ſaid</hi> Iudges <hi>knew that this Commisſion was awarded in Parliament, &amp;c. that it was for the Publick Good; That they knew of the Traiterous Intent to deſtroy the Procurers of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misſion; That they knew the Law, and that it was not Treaſon, and had delivered ſuch Opinions thereby, under colour of Law, to cover their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Intent,</hi> and therefore Iudgment of <hi>High-Treaſon</hi> was given againſt them, and againſt <hi>Locton</hi> the Kings <hi>Serjeant,</hi> who had Subſcribed theſe Falſe Opinions with the <hi>Iudges.</hi> And though there be other Articles againſt the <hi>Reſt,</hi> yet this alone is adjudged <hi>Treaſon,</hi> in the ſeveral <hi>Iudgments</hi> againſt every one of the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen: And 'tis obſervable, <hi>That in all theſe Iudgments, they are adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51465:9"/>Traitors as well againſt the Perſon of the King, as againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is there declared upon great Advice taken, <hi>That in Treaſons which concern the King and Kingdom, they are not bound to proceed according to the Rules of the Common-Law, but according to the Courſe of Parliaments, ſo as may be for the Common-Good.</hi> Nor were theſe <hi>Iudgments</hi> huddled up in haſte, but given upon long and mature Deliberation, <hi>the Work of a Whole Parliament.</hi> And it is declared in the <hi>Roll, That they ſpent long time, and took great pains in examining the Evidence,</hi> the better thereby to ſatisfie their own Conſciences and the World. Their Proceedings againſt the five Plotters were begun the 14 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> and the <hi>Iudgments</hi> were not given till the 15 of <hi>Feb.</hi> following, which is a <hi>Quarter</hi> of a <hi>Year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis alſo to be obſerved, <hi>That ſeveral of theſe Iudges were very unwilling to give their</hi> Corrupt Opinions, <hi>but were</hi> menaced <hi>and</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently <hi>drawn thereunto by the Duke of</hi> Ireland <hi>and others.</hi> And at their <hi>Trials,</hi> they ſeverally Alledged, <hi>That in part</hi> Violence <hi>had been offered to their Perſons, becauſe they had deferred the delivery of their Opinions.</hi> But as <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Cowardice</hi> is no <hi>Plea</hi> for delivering up of the <hi>Forts</hi> or <hi>Bulwarks</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſo neither is it for <hi>baſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying our Rights and Liberties.</hi> Theſe Allegations of being <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their Duty,</hi> could not excuſe them from the <hi>Rope:</hi> but how much more then do they deſerve it who ſhall preſume to do as bad things or <hi>worſe,</hi> without any <hi>Menaces</hi> at all, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and preſumptuouſly, purely out of their own baſe inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Treſilian</hi> was not the onely Iudge which our <hi>Engliſh Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi> even ſince the Conqueſt, mentions to have been executed for irregular Practices: For in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, a <hi>Wiſe</hi> but <hi>Avaritious</hi> Prince, there were two Gentlemen of the Long Robe, that for private Intereſt, and to ſerve the Kings preſent <hi>Turn,</hi> were ready to diſpence with their <hi>Oaths,</hi> and the known Fundamental Laws. But as they liv'd <hi>hated</hi> during his time, ſo they died <hi>unlamented</hi> under his Succeſſor, being given up a neceſſary <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to <hi>Publick Iustice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Names</hi> were, Sir <hi>Richard Empſon</hi> Knight, and <hi>Edmund Dudley,</hi> both (ſaith Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> fol. 247.) <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and both of them <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>England: Dudley</hi> of a good Family, but <hi>Empſon</hi> the Son of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51465:9"/>a <hi>Sieve-maker:</hi> So true is that Remark of the <hi>Poet;</hi>
               <q>Mendico aſperius nihil eſt cum ſurgit ad Altum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is no Perſon in the World more <hi>Haughty,</hi> or an <hi>Apter Tool</hi> for Oppreſſion, than a <hi>Beggars Bratt,</hi> or ſome baſe <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, Butcherly Off-ſpring,</hi> when undeſervedly fluſh't with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> made odd Uſe of theſe Two Inſtruments. <hi>They turn'd</hi> (ſayes <hi>Baker</hi>) <hi>Law into Rapine.</hi> And moſt certain it is, that many ill Things they did: But the better to colour their vile Practiſes, a Statute was Provided, to Juſtify their Invaſions on the Liberties and Properties of their <hi>Fellow-Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will give you an Account of this Matter, in the very Words of that Great <hi>Oracle of our Law,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Cook.</hi> But firſt, hear how Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> in his <hi>Chronicle, fol.</hi> 247. repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Their Manner was <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> to cauſe divers Subjects to be Indicted of Crimes, and then preſently to Commit them, and not Produce them to their Anſwer, but ſuffer them to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh long in Priſon; and by ſundry Artificial Devices and Terror, extort from them great <hi>Fines,</hi> which they termed <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> and <hi>Mitigations.</hi> Neither did they (towards the End) obſerve ſo much as the Half-Face of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in Proceeding by Indictment; but ſent forth their Precepts to Attach Men, and Convent them before Themſelves, and ſome Others, at their private Houſes; and there ſhuffle up a Summary Proceeding by Examination, <hi>Without Tryal by Iury;</hi> aſſuming to themſelves to deal both in <hi>Pleas of the Crown,</hi> and <hi>Controverſies Civil.</hi> Then did they alſo uſe to Enthral, and Charge the Subjects Land with Tenures <hi>in Capite,</hi> by finding Falſe Offices, refuſing upon divers Pretexts and Delayes, to admit Men to Traverſe thoſe Falſe Offices. Nay, contrary to all Law and Colour, they maintain'd, That the <hi>King</hi> ought to have the Half of Mens Lands and Rents, during the Space of full Two Years, for a Pain, in caſe of <hi>Outlawry.</hi> They would likewiſe <hi>Ruffle</hi> with <hi>Jurors,</hi> and enforce them to Find, as they would Direct: And if they did not, then Convent, Impriſon, and Fine them. Theſe, and many other Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they had, of Preying upon the People, and had ever a <hi>Rabble</hi> of <hi>Promoters,</hi> and <hi>Leading Jurors</hi> at their Command, ſo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51465:10"/>as they could have <hi>any Thing</hi> found, either for <hi>Fact,</hi> or <hi>Valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far the <hi>Hiſtorian.</hi> Now, take the Relation of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Judge <hi>Cook,</hi>
               </hi> in his ever-valuable Works, Commenting in the <hi>Second Part</hi> of his <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> on that <hi>GOLDEN Nine</hi> and <hi>Twentyeth Chapter</hi> of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> which being of <hi>Ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Value,</hi> I take it for granted, no True <hi>Engliſh Man</hi> will any more grudge the <hi>Reading,</hi> than I do the <hi>Recital</hi> of it; and I wiſh it might every <hi>Market-Day,</hi> be repeated with a <hi>Speaking-Trumpet,</hi> in every Town and Corporation of this Kingdom.

               <hi>Againſt this Antient and Fundamental Law, and in the Face there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I find an Act of Parliament made</hi> 11 H. 7. Cap. 3. <hi>That as well Juſtices of Aſſize, as Juſtices of the Peace, (without any Finding, or Preſentment by the Verdict of Twelve Men) upon a bare Information for the King, before them made, ſhould have full Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by their Diſcretions, to Hear and Determine all Offences,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Fourth Part, Inſtit. fol.</hi> 39. he gives a further Account of, and Recites this Act thus:</p>
            <q>
               <p>There was an Act of Parliament made in the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which had a <hi>Fair, Flattering</hi> Preamble, pretending to avoid divers Miſchiefs, which were, 1. The High Diſpleaſure of Almighty <hi>God.</hi> 2. The great Let of the Common-Law. And, 3. The great Let of the Wealth of this Land. And the Purview of that Act tended in the Execution contrary, <hi>Ex Diametro,</hi> viz. To the Diſpleaſure of Almighty <hi>God,</hi> The
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51465:10"/>great Let, nay, the utter Subverſion of the Common-Law, and, The great Let of the Wealth of this Land; Which Act followeth in theſe Words:</p>

               </hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> and the Extrajudicial and <hi>Ilegal</hi> Opinions of the <hi>Judges</hi> therein Delivered, with the diſmal <hi>Conſequences</hi> thereof, as well to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to the <hi>King,</hi> and whole Realm.</p>
            <p>KING <hi>Charles the Firſt</hi> came to the Crown 27 <hi>March,</hi> 1625. In the <hi>Three Firſt</hi> Years of His Reign, he call'd <hi>Three ſeveral Parliaments;</hi> but none of them Complying to give ſo much <hi>Money,</hi> as was Expected: But rather inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Complaints againſt <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the then Grand <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,</hi> and to have <hi>Publick Grievances</hi> Redreſſed, They were all <hi>Diſſolved</hi> in Diſcontent; and no more <hi>Parliaments</hi> ſpoken of, till that of the <hi>Thirteenth of April,</hi> 1640. (which was likewiſe ſuddenly <hi>Diſſolved.</hi>) During this long Interval, or Abſence of thoſe whom the Laws had Entruſted with Keeping the <hi>Right Keys</hi> of the <hi>Publick Purſe,</hi> there were ſome that would needs be Tampering to <hi>Pick</hi> it; I mean, ſeveral <hi>little Intrigues</hi> were ſet on Foot, to Supply the <hi>Court,</hi> and get <hi>Money</hi> from the Subjects, without their <hi>Common Conſent</hi> in <hi>Parliament;</hi> (that good Old Courſe, which <hi>Never Fail'd</hi> any <hi>KING,</hi> upon any Juſt Occaſion, or where they knew it ſhould not be diverted to the <hi>KING</hi>'s Diſhonor, and the Nations further Grievance) Of this kind were, 1. The Privy Seals iſſued. 2. Benevolence required. 3. Commiſſions of Loan. 4. The Buſineſs of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; whereby all perſons Seiz'd of Lands and Rents of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pounds per Annum,</hi> or upwards, were by Proclamation Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd, either to appear, and take upon them the Degree of Knighthood, or elſe were liable to be Fined for Reſpite of the ſame. Which (alone ſaith <hi>Baker, fol.</hi> 449.) brought an <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Pounds</hi> or more, into the <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this was ſtill thought too little: Theſe <hi>Devices</hi> might ſerve for a preſent <hi>Shift,</hi> once, and no more; but there wanted a <hi>Continual Fund,</hi> or <hi>Conſtant Supply,</hi> as oft as the <hi>Court</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51465:13"/>wanted, or thought fit to require Mony, without being behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Parliaments. Whereupon, <hi>5ly.</hi> By the fatal Advice (as 'tis ſaid) of <hi>Noy,</hi> the then Attorney General, the King was put upon this Project of raiſing Mony, by Iſſuing out Writs, Commanding his Subjects to be Rated, and Aſſeſſed in ſuch and ſuch Sums, for Building, and Equipping of <hi>Ships,</hi> for the publick Defence of the Kingdom: Which the ſaid Attorney perſwaded his Majeſty might be Juſtified by antient Precedents. In purſuance hereof, the King in the <hi>Nineth</hi> Year of his Reign, Iſſued out certain Writs of that kind, to the <hi>Sea-Ports,</hi> and <hi>Maritine</hi> Parts of the Realm: And finding (for the moſt part) a punctual Obedience, and good Advantage thereby; it was in ſhort time after, adviſed to Extend the ſame Charge to all the <hi>Counties</hi> of this Realm, though never ſo remote from the Seas; wherein, meeting with ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51465:14"/>divers Counſels, and Attempts to take from us the Dominion of the Seas; of which we are ſole Lord, and Right Owner, and Proprietor; and the Loſs whereof, would be of greateſt Danger and Peril to this Kingdom, and other our Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and many other ways. We for the avoiding of theſe, and the like Dangers; well Weighing with our ſelf, that where the Good, and Safety of the Kingdom in general is concern'd, and the whole Kingdom in Danger, there the Charge, and Defence ought to be Borne by all the Realm in general, did for the preventing ſo publick a Miſchief, reſolve with our ſelf, to have a Royal Navy prepared, that might be of Force and Power (with Almighty <hi>God</hi>'s Bleſſing and Aſſiſtance) to Protect, and Defend this our Realm, and our Subjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, from all ſuch Perils and Dangers: And for that purpoſe, we Iſſued forth Writs under our great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to all our Sheriffs of our ſeveral Counties of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> Commanding thereby all our ſaid Subjects in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City, Town, and Village, to provide ſuch a Number of Ships well-furniſh't, as might ſerve for this Royal Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and which might be done with the greateſt Equality that could be. In performance whereof, though generally throughout all the Counties of this our Realm, we have found in our Subjects, great Chearfulneſs, and Alacrity; which we Graciouſly Interpret as a Teſtimony, as well of their Dutiful Affection to us, and our Service, as of the Reſpect they have to the Publick, which well becometh every good Subject. Nevertheleſs, finding that ſome few happily out of Ignorance, what the Laws and Cuſtoms of this Realm are, or out of a deſire to be eaſed in their Particulars, how General ſoever their Charge be, or ought to be, have not yet Paid, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to their ſeveral Rates, and Seſsments that were ſet upon them.

Studied, and Informed in the Rights of our Sovereignty; and becauſe the Tryals of our ſeveral Courts, by the Formalities in Pleading,

            <p>But it is to be noted, That though all the <hi>Judges</hi> did thus Sign this Anſwer; yet it was not according to all their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; for <hi>Crook</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi> diſ-aſſented, and declared, That ſuch a Charge could not be laid by any ſuch Writ; but by <hi>Parliament.</hi> But the Major-Part of the <hi>Judges,</hi> being abſolutely Reſolved upon that Opinion, preſſed them to Subſcribe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the reſt; for that the Greater Number muſt involve and conclude the Leſs; which, they ſaid, was uſual in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Reference; And that the Leſſer Number muſt ſubmit to the Opinion of the More, although they varied in Opinion: As in the Courts of Law; If <hi>Three Judges</hi> agree in Opinion againſt <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two,</hi> where there is <hi>Five Judges,</hi> Judgment is to be Entred <hi>per Curiam,</hi> if the <hi>Major Part</hi> agree, and the <hi>Others</hi> are to ſubmit unto it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Theſe are the very Words of <hi>Judge Crook,</hi> excuſing himſelf for having thus Subſcribed: See the <hi>Arguments</hi> on <hi>Hampden</hi>'s <hi>Caſe,</hi> p. 12.)</p>
            <p>Having thus got the Buſineſs <hi>back't</hi> with the <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> of all the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the ſame were <hi>Enrolled</hi> in all the Courts of <hi>Westminſter-Hall:</hi> And now, they began to Proſecute brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the <hi>Defaulters;</hi> amongſt whom, the Chiefeſt was <hi>John Hampden</hi> of <hi>Buckingham-ſhire,</hi> Eſquire, who had upon one of theſe Ship - Writs directed to the Sheriff of that County, been Aſſeſſed <hi>Twenty Shillings</hi> for his Lands in <hi>Stoke-Mandevil,</hi> in that County; which not being paid, was Certified (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) into the <hi>Chancery,</hi> upon a Writ of <hi>Certiorari,</hi> Dated 9

               <hi>Martii, Anno</hi> 12. <hi>Car.</hi> by a <hi>Schedule</hi> thereunto annexed; and by a Writ of <hi>Mittimus, Teſte</hi> 5 <hi>Maii,</hi> 13 <hi>Car.</hi> tranſmitted into the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> with a Command there, to do for the Leavying of the Sums ſo Aſſeſſed and Unpaid; <hi>Prout de Jure, &amp; ſecundum, Legem Regni noſtri</hi> Angliae <hi>ſuerit faciendum; So as of Right, and according to the Law of our Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>was to be done;</hi> whereupon a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> iſſued out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> reciting the ſaid Writs, to warn Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> (amongſt others) to ſhew Cauſe, why he ſhould not be Charged with this Money. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, he being Summoned, Appeared, and demanded <hi>Oyer</hi> of thoſe <hi>Writs</hi> and <hi>Schedule;</hi> which being Entred, he <hi>Demurr'd in Law;</hi> that is, demanded the Opinion and Judgment of the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> Whether this <hi>Writ</hi> were ſufficient <hi>in Law,</hi> to Force him to pay the ſaid <hi>Twenty Shillings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being a <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>General Caſe,</hi> the Barons of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> deſired the Aſſiſtance of the reſt of the <hi>Judges,</hi> who did Joyn accordingly. The Caſe was argued, firſt, by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel on both Sides; and next, by the <hi>Judges</hi> ſeverally; of whom, Sir <hi>Richard Hutton,</hi> Knight, one of the Judges of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Crook,</hi> Knight, one of the Judges of the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> in large and learned Arguments, (ſince Printed) did ſhew the <hi>Illegality</hi> of ſuch Writs, and gave their Opinion; <hi>That the Defendant</hi> Hampden, <hi>ought not to be Charged:</hi> But the reſt of the <hi>Judges</hi> were reſolved to carry the Point for the <hi>King;</hi> and accordingly gave their Opinions, <hi>That the Defendant ought to be Charged.</hi> And then, it was the Part of the <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> to give <hi>Judgment;</hi> which was Entred in theſe Words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quod ſeperalia Brevia predicta, &amp; Retorn' eorundem, ac Schedul' prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict' eiſdem Annex', ac materia in eiſdem content' ſufficient' in Lege Exiſt' ad praefat</hi> Johannem Hampdem <hi>de predictis viginti ſolidis ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ipſum informa, &amp; ex cauſa praedictae Aſſeſſae onerand.

                  </gap>ctus</hi> Johannes Hampden. <hi>de eiſdem viginti ſolidis oneretur, &amp; inde ſatisfaciat: That the ſaid ſeveral Writs and Returns thereof, and the Schedules thereunto annex't, and the Matter in the ſame contained, are ſufficient in Law to Charge the ſaid</hi> John Hampden <hi>with, the Twenty Shillings upon him, in the Form, and by Vertue of the Aſſeſsment afore-ſaid impoſed. Therefore, it is conſidered by the ſaid Barons, That the ſaid</hi> John Hampden <hi>ſhall be Charged, and ſhall ſatisfy the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Judgment</hi> was impoſed, as ſuch an <hi>Infallible Determination</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:51465:16"/>of the Law in this Caſe, that no further Diſpute would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd thereof to any others; inſomuch, that a Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, having a Caſe depending in the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed any Argument or Debate, concerning the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> for no other Reaſon, but that it had been by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Judgment,</hi> decided already in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may perhaps be ſaid: <hi>This Impoſition of</hi> Ship-Money <hi>was</hi> ſmall <hi>and</hi> inconſiderable; <hi>Mr.</hi> Hampden, <hi>a Gentleman of a fair Fſtare, was Aſſeſſed but</hi> Twenty Shillings: <hi>And, Why ſhould any Body-ſcruple ſuch a petty Buſineſs, when the</hi> King <hi>Commanded it? Was not the</hi> Remedy <hi>far worſe than the</hi> Diſeaſe? <hi>Why ſhould any Subject exſpend a great deal of Money in Law, to avoid Payment of ſo</hi> Trivial <hi>a Sum? Or, What Harm could accrue to the</hi> Publick, <hi>by the</hi> Judges <hi>allowing the</hi> King <hi>Power to Impoſe ſuch an Aſſeſsment, when it was for the Defence of the Realm from</hi> Eminent <hi>and</hi> Imminent <hi>Danger, and he exerted that Power ſo favourably,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to ſuch <hi>Objections,</hi> it muſt be ſaid; That true it is, it was then only Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi>'s Caſe; but the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every individual Subject of <hi>England,</hi> was concern'd in it: nay, ſo far concern'd, that all his Eſtate and Liberty was therein given up. The <hi>Queſtion</hi> was not <hi>Quantum,</hi> but <hi>Quo Jure?</hi> If Publick Danger might give the <hi>King</hi> Title to lay Impoſitions without a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and He alone were <hi>Judge</hi> of ſuch Danger, When might it not be alledged? If <hi>Twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> were Aſſeſſed on Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> that Year, How did it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> might be required the next, and <hi>Two Thouſand Pounds</hi> the Year following? And, What Uſe, what Occaſion would the <hi>Court</hi> have had for ever afterwards, of a <hi>Parliament?</hi> But as to the <hi>Illegality</hi> of theſe <hi>Ship-Writs,</hi> I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to Judge <hi>Crook</hi>'s <hi>Argument;</hi> where the ſame is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to be againſt the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> againſt divers <hi>Statutes,</hi> not to be maintain'd by any <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or Power Royal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable by any former <hi>Precedents,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee then, what were the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of theſe <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial</hi> Opinions, and this <hi>Illegal</hi> Judgment of the <hi>Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the <hi>King:</hi> They thereby miſ-led him (as much as in them lay) to Diſcompoſe the Harmony of <hi>Government;</hi> to Entrench upon the <hi>Property</hi> of His Subjects; and (contrary to his Intentions) by Colour of Right, to violate the Laws, which, no doubt, that <hi>Good Prince</hi> meant to have preſerv'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:51465:16"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the <hi>Subjects:</hi> They were not only hereby In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, but their <hi>Affections Alienated</hi> from their Sovereign; which to occaſion, is no doubt a very High (becauſe almoſt Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable) <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Genuine Senſe of theſe <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> being no leſs than this; That the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> as <hi>often</hi> as Himſelf pleaſeth, may declare the Kingdom to be in Danger, and that ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, His Majeſty, for Prevention of ſuch Dangers, may, by His Writ under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> alter the <hi>Property</hi> of the Subject's Goods, without their Conſent in <hi>Parliamen;</hi> and that in <hi>ſuch Proportions,</hi> as His Majeſty ſhall think fit: And beſides, may deprive them of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of their Perſons, and that in ſuch Manner as Himſelf ſhall pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the <hi>Judges</hi> themſelves: It prov'd deſervedly <hi>Fatal;</hi> For no ſooner was a <hi>Parliament</hi> Call'd, but they were call'd to Account for theſe their Illegal Opinions and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And after a long Debate, on <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1640. theſe <hi>Four</hi> ſeveral <hi>Votes</hi> Paſſed upon them, without ſo much as <hi>One Negative Voice</hi> to any of them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>THat the Charge impoſed upon the Subjects, for the Providing and Furniſhing of Ships; and the Aſſeſsments for Raiſing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for that purpoſe, commonly called Ship-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, are againſt the Laws of the Realm, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Right of Property, and contrary to former Reſolutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Extrajudicial Opinions of the Iudges, Publiſhed in the</hi> Star-Chamber, <hi>and Inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Courts at</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>(before Recited) in the whole, and in every part of them are againſt the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, and the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Reſolutions in Parliament; and to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Writ to the Sheriff of</hi> Bucks <hi>(particularly Recited) and the other Writs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Ship-Writs; are againſt the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51465:17"/>of the Subjects, and contrary to former Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the Iudgment in Mr.</hi> Hampden's <hi>Caſe (as before Recited) in the matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof; and in that it was conceived that Mr.</hi> Hampden <hi>was any way Chargeable, is againſt the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reſolutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Votes</hi> being Tranſmitted by the <hi>Commons</hi> to the <hi>Houſe of Lords;</hi> Their Lordſhips did Concur therein. And on <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 26. of <hi>February,</hi> 1640. It was Ordered by the Lords <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> in the High <hi>Court of Parliament,</hi> Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; That the <hi>Lord-Keeper,</hi> or <hi>Maſter of the Rolls,</hi> the <hi>Two</hi> Lord <hi>Chief Juſtices,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Chief Baron;</hi> and likewiſe the <hi>Chief Clerk of the Star-Chamber,</hi> ſhould bring into the Upper <hi>Houſe of Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Records</hi> of the Judgment againſt Mr. <hi>Hampden,</hi> concerning <hi>Ship-Money,</hi> in each of thoſe ſeveral Courts, and that a <hi>Vacat</hi> thereof ſhould be made. And that a Copy of the Judgment of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> concerning the <hi>Illegality</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhould be Delivered to the ſeveral <hi>Judges of Aſſize;</hi> and that they ſhould be required to Publiſh the ſame in all the <hi>Circuits.</hi> Which on the 27. of the ſame <hi>February,</hi> was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: the ſaid <hi>Records</hi> being <hi>Vacated,</hi> and the <hi>Rolls</hi> Croſs'd with a Pen in the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> and Subſcribed with the <hi>Clerk</hi> of the <hi>Parliament's</hi> Hand.</p>
            <p>And ſoon after, ſeveral of the before-named Judges were <hi>Impeached</hi> for the ſame in <hi>Parliament:</hi> And not daring to ſtand the <hi>Shock,</hi> ſome of them, as the Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice Finch,</hi> Fled beyond the Seas; and <hi>others</hi> Abſconded. And ſoon after, came on the Unnatural <hi>Civil-Wars,</hi> ſo Deſtructive to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> which, though no way Juſtifiable, yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed; but they were not a little <hi>Occaſion'd,</hi> and the Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People, blown into an Untameable <hi>Flame,</hi> by theſe baſe Traiterous Proceedings of thoſe <hi>Sycophant Judges.</hi> And <hi>Woe unto thoſe</hi> (ſay Sacred <hi>Oracles</hi>) <hi>by whom Offences come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, after ſo many diſmal Experiences, and fair Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Miraculous <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of His preſent Majeſty,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51465:17"/>our Gracious Soveraign (whom <hi>God</hi> long Preſerve) a <hi>Prince</hi> of Incomparable Lenity, and Good-natur'd beyond Example; it might be hoped, that none, Preferr'd to the <hi>Publick Seats of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> durſt to have Acted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o contrary to His Royal Incimations, as to violate thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> which He Himſelf has <hi>Sworn</hi> to Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and Intruſted them to <hi>Adminiſter:</hi> Yet ſo Baſe and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant are ſome, as even to abuſe the Favours of the <hi>Beſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and puff't up with Preferment, will take no Admonition from the Falls of their <hi>Head-ſtrong</hi> Predeceſſors; but ſtill preſume to ſully thoſe <hi>Ermins,</hi> (the <hi>Emblems</hi> of <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi>) which they wear, and adventure: on the ſame Deſtructive Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices.</p>
            <p>You have heard, how heinouſly our Prudent Anceſtors reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Violation of their <hi>Liberties,</hi> (though by an Act) in Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the Free-born People of <hi>England <hi>Without Iuries.</hi>
               </hi> Next to which, is the <hi>Ruffing, Hectoring,</hi> and <hi>Over-awing</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi> For, What real Difference is there, betwixt allowing no <hi>Juries</hi> at all, and <hi>Menacing</hi> them into a Compliance (contrary to <hi>Law,</hi> and their own <hi>Conſciences</hi>) with the Corrupt Humours, and Time - ſerving Intereſts of ill Judges? Of this Crime, the Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice Keeling,</hi> about the Year 1666. (a Time when <hi>God's</hi> General Judgments on this Sinful Land, might have awakened them to greater Circumſpection and Uprightneſs) was not only Guilty, but Queſtion'd for the ſame, even by <hi>That</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was never extraordinarily Celebrated for bringing <hi>Publick Vermine</hi> to Puniſhment: Yet ſuch a Senſe they had of theſe ill Practiſes, that in their <hi>Journal,</hi> we find the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Votes</hi> on this Occaſion.</p>

            <p>This well-contrived, neceſſary <hi>Oath,</hi> preſcribed by the Prudence of our Fore-Fathers, would bear a large <hi>Comment;</hi> but we muſt haſten, and ſhall only remarque:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they Swear, <hi>Well and Truly</hi> (that is, <hi>Uprightly,</hi> and according to <hi>Law</hi>) <hi>to Serve the</hi> King, <hi>and his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they ſhall do <hi>Equal Right, and Execution of Law, to all the</hi> King's <hi>Subjects, Rich and Poor;</hi> (that is, without <hi>Partiality, Favour, Malice,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Juſtice</hi> is Pictured <hi>Blind</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> not the <hi>Object:</hi> She has a <hi>Ballance,</hi> not to weigh <hi>Gold,</hi> but the <hi>Crime:</hi> She has regard to <hi>Offences,</hi> not <hi>Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That if any <hi>Letters from the King</hi> (unduely obtain'd, for ſo all ſuch are ſuppoſed to be) ſhall be brough to them, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law,</hi> they are not to regard them; much leſs are they to value any <hi>Verbal</hi> Commands, or little <hi>Raskally Inſinuations</hi> of any <hi>Court-Favourites,</hi> huffing <hi>Grandees,</hi> or ſmall <hi>Minions</hi> of State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That by this their <hi>Oath, Judges</hi> are to proceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Law;</hi> their Buſineſs is <hi>Jus Dicere,</hi> to Declare and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Laws Eſtabliſh't; not <hi>Jus Dare,</hi> to Impoſe their own Whimſical, Arbitrary, <hi>Peeviſh,</hi> or Self-deſigning Opinions, for <hi>Law;</hi> or to Uſurp a <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Power, ſo as deliver that to be Law, which in truth is not ſo. And if they ſhall preſume to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend herein, they are <hi>Exemplarily</hi> to be puniſhed: For ſince 'tis a known <hi>Maxime</hi> of Law, <hi>Ignorantia Juris non excuſat, That Ignorance of the Law ſhall excuſe no Man;</hi> (The Reaſon of which, is, becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man is ſuppoſed to be <hi>Privy,</hi> and conſenting to all our Laws, by his <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> in <hi>Parliament.</hi>) How much leſs are <hi>Judges</hi> (whoſe <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> it is to Underſtand the Law; and therefore, muſt take Notice of it, at their <hi>Peril</hi>) to be Indulg'd? Under what Character will they plead Excuſe? Are they Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of known <hi>Learning,</hi> and ſtrong <hi>Natural Parts,</hi> great <hi>Reading,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:51465:19"/>exquſite <hi>Eloquence, &amp;c?</hi> All this but <hi>aggravates</hi> their Fault, that they ſhould abuſe ſuch good Gifts, to the Diſhonour of the <hi>King</hi> that Commiſſions them, and Prejudice of His <hi>People</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected more exact Dealings from ſuch Eminent Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Will they ſhelter themſelves under the before-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Plea</hi> of <hi>Ignorance?</hi> This is already ſhewn to be an Invalid Allegation; and beſides, 'tis a Reflection on that <hi>Royal Power</hi> that Preferr'd them: And, What infinite Miſchiefs (of which there is no Particular <hi>Complaint</hi> or <hi>Information</hi>) may the Subjects ſuffer in their <hi>Lives,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> under ſuch <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which is alwayes attended with Equal <hi>Preſumption?</hi> Or, <hi>laſtly,</hi> Suppoſe it ſhould be offered in their Favour, That for ſome time, at firſt, they were <hi>Upright,</hi> and have had the Reputation of Prudence and Integrity, in all Caſes, except <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch:</hi> for which <hi>Now</hi> they are queſtioned: To this it may be fitly Anſwer'd, (as he of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Athenians</hi>) If they carryed themſelves <hi>Well,</hi> when Time was, and now <hi>Ill,</hi> they deſerve a <hi>Double</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; becauſe they are not <hi>Good,</hi> as they <hi>were;</hi> and becauſe they are <hi>Evil,</hi> as they <hi>were not.</hi> The <hi>Judges,</hi> 'tis true, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the <hi>Parliament-Roll</hi> of the 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. to be <hi>Executors</hi> of the <hi>Statutes,</hi> Judgments, and Ordinances of <hi>Parliament:</hi> But they muſt not make themſelves the <hi>Executioners</hi> of them too, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Deſtruction of the Fundamentals of our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> is the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> whither the Subject is to run for Shelter and Defence: But if the Judges, <hi>Sacerdotes Juſtiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

We ſhall have the Dead <hi>Killing-Letter</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> but not the Quickening, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Senſe</hi> of it: The Fabrick and Formalities of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> but the <hi>Goddeſs Aſtraea,</hi> and the <hi>Dii Tutelares,</hi> all that ſhould Conſerve our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> will be vaniſh't: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, we ſhall have but an <hi>Indian Pa-god,</hi> a frightful, terrible <hi>Idol</hi> of <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> delighting in <hi>Humane Sacrifices,</hi> and only Adorable for Averting that <hi>Miſchief,</hi> with which it threatens us.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Contraria juxta ſe poſita magis eluceſcunt: Contraries illuſtrate each other.</hi> We have hitherto Treated the <hi>Reader</hi> with <hi>Doleſome Narratives</hi> of <hi>Lewd Judges:</hi> Let us now (briefly) Entertain him

            </p>
            <p>In the Reign of King <hi>H.</hi> 4. His Son and Heir apparent (then a <hi>Wild Youth,</hi> but afterwards as Solid, and Renowned a King, as moſt that have ſway'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Scepter) hearing that one of his Companions was Arraigned for Felony before the Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> (I am ſorry my narrow Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has not brought me acquainted with his Honourable Name) came to the Bar, and offered to take away the <hi>Priſoner</hi> by force; but being withſtood by the ſaid Chief Juſtice, ſtepped to him, and <hi>Struck</hi> him over the Face; whereat the Judge nothing daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, roſe up, and with a <hi>Gravity</hi> becoming his Dignity, told him, That he did not this Affront to <hi>Him,</hi> but to the King his <hi>Father,</hi> in whoſe Place he ſate; and therefore, forthwith Committed him to Priſon. The Prince <hi>Over-aw'd</hi> with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the <hi>Sage Judge</hi>'s Expreſſions, calmly Suffered himſelf to be carried away by an ordinary <hi>Tip-Staff;</hi> which being told the King, He not a little Rejoyced, both that he had a <hi>Judge</hi> of ſuch Couragious Integrity; and a <hi>Son</hi> of ſuch Submiſſive Obedience to his Laws, <hi>Vide Baker fol.</hi> 163.</p>
            <p>The Famous Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> having required a <hi>Charge</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers of Her Subjects, by particular Letters from the Lords of Her Council, of ſeveral <hi>Sums</hi> of Money, for preſent Aid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Her Wars in <hi>Ireland;</hi> hearing that one of Her <hi>Judges,</hi> viz. Mr. Juſtice <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> being conven'd before the ſaid Lords, for Non-Payment thereof, thereby Diſcouraging others; had Anſwered, That it was <hi>Contrary to Law</hi> that the ſame ſhould be Impoſed, there being an Expreſs <hi>Statute</hi> againſt it; which He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Judge,</hi> was bound by his Oath, to ſignifie to Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, he being (as much as in him lay) a Conſervator of the <hi>Queens Oath</hi> in that behalf; Her Majeſty was much Offended, that any ſuch Impoſition had been pretended to, and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it ſhould be ſtopped from further <hi>Gathering;</hi> and to ſuch as had paid it, their Money, by Her expreſs Order, was <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. Judge Crooks Argument</hi> in <hi>Hampden's Caſe,</hi> p. 57.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>29th.</hi> of the ſame Queen, Her Majeſty having Erected a New-Office in the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> for making of <hi>Superſedeas</hi> on <hi>Exigents,</hi> She Grants it to one <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> Her Servant; ſends to have him admitted, but the Judges delay the doing thereof, On this Reaſon, becauſe the <hi>Prothonotaries,</hi> and <hi>Philizers</hi> Claimed the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51465:20"/>making thoſe Writs. The Queen ſends a <hi>Sharp</hi> Letter, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them forthwith to Admit him: Then She ſends a more poſitive Command, requiring the Reaſon of their <hi>Contempt</hi> and Diſobedience. The Judges return the beforementioned Reaſon to the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (no mean Man in thoſe Days) upon which, the Queen ſends a <hi>Fourth Peremptory</hi> Meſſage for their Admitting him, with this Reaſon: That if the others were put out, they were <hi>Rich,</hi> and Able Men, and that Her Courts of Juſtice were <hi>Open,</hi> where they might Demand their Right; for this was not to debar them <hi>Therefrom,</hi> but only to put them to their <hi>Action.</hi> The <hi>Honeſt Judges</hi> roturned this Anſwer, That the Queen had taken Her <hi>Oath,</hi> for the due Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Juſtice <hi>According to Law,</hi> and they did not doubt, but when Her Majeſty was Informed it was againſt the Law, She would Act therein as became her. For their own parts, they had taken an <hi>Oath</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Her,</hi> and the <hi>Common-Wealth;</hi> And if they ſhould do it without <hi>Proceſs</hi> of Law before them, and only upon Her Command put the others out of Poſſeſſion, though the Right remained to them, it were a Breach of their <hi>Oath;</hi> and therefore, if the Fear of <hi>God</hi> were not Sufficient, they told Her the Puniſhment, that was Inflicted upon their <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> for Breach of their Oaths (citing <hi>Thorpe,</hi> &amp;c.) might be a ſufficient <hi>Warning</hi> to them: Whereupon the Queen hearing theſe Reaſons, was Satisfied; and the ſaid Judges heard no more of this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>To Deſcend nearer our own Times, we cannot omit that grand Example of <hi>Uprightneſs,</hi> the ever Famous Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> late Lord Chief Juſtice of the King's-Bench; a <hi>Miracle</hi> for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>Polite</hi> and <hi>Serious</hi> Learning, as well as profound Knowledge in the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Of whom I ſhall yet, not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any particular <hi>Inſtances,</hi> ſince his whole Life was one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Thred of <hi>Sincere, and Underſtanding Juſtice:</hi> For as eaſily you might have juſtled the <hi>Sun</hi> out of the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> as to have warp'd him from his conſtant Road of <hi>Integrity.</hi> An exact <hi>Standard</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Future Princes</hi> may meaſure the Qualifications of their <hi>Judges;</hi> for though he were a moſt <hi>Loyal,</hi> and Zealous Servant to the <hi>Crown;</hi> yet he was ſo far from being ever <hi>Impeached</hi> by the <hi>Repreſentative Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of the Nation, that no one <hi>Single</hi> Perſon (no not of thoſe that were <hi>Caſt</hi> before him) were ever heard to complain of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>And if any <hi>Latter</hi> Judges have been diſmiſs'd by falſe Tales of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51465:21"/>Sycophant <hi>Whiſperers,</hi> or for oppoſing baſe <hi>Illegal Arbitrary Intereſts;</hi> as they have the Invaluable Satisfaction of a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> for their Comfort; ſo they may be aſſured, they ſtill appear more Glorious in the Eyes of all good <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men at preſent, and will be Recorded more Venerable to Poſterity, than any <hi>Robes</hi> or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, ſullied with <hi>Bribery, Flattery,</hi> or <hi>Treacherous</hi> Compliances, could renden them.</p>
            <p>However, we hope the <hi>Various Examples,</hi> we have here Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated from Authentick <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> may be ſufficient to Deterr future <hi>Judges</hi> from Ill Courſes; and ſatisfie all the World, both in the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the Parliaments late Proceedings in this Caſe, and the <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of their <hi>Vote</hi> and intended <hi>Bill,</hi> That <hi>Judges</hi> henceforth ſhould hold their Places, and Salaries, not <hi>Ad Placitum;</hi> but <hi>Quam Diu ſe bene gaſſerint.</hi> Which was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Aim of theſe Papers. <hi>Fiat Juſtitia.</hi>
